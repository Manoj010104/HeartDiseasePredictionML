=============================

**End-to-End Heart Disease Classification: A Step-by-Step Guide** 🚀

Hey there, ML enthusiasts 🤖!

This repository is all about building a robust machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient features. We'll take you through a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to create an end-to-end heart disease classification system.

### What You'll Learn

- **Data Preprocessing**: How to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale/normalize numerical features 📊.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques to extract relevant features from the dataset to improve model performance 🔧.
- **Model Selection**: Comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines) to select the best model for the task 🤔.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training the selected model, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score 📈.

### Requirements

- **Python**: The project uses Python as the primary programming language 🐍.
- **Libraries**: You'll need the following libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

### Get Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine 💻.
2. Open the `End_to_end_Heartdisease_classification.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment 📝.
3. Follow the instructions and execute the cells in sequence to reproduce the results 💪.
